Regarding your question about continuing in a fresh chat, here's what you should provide to get me up to speed quickly:

Brief project description: Express.js API for user management with PostgreSQL and image uploads.
Current progress: Basic Express setup complete, PostgreSQL database connected and tested.
Key technologies: Express.js, PostgreSQL (in Docker), Multer (for future image uploads), JWT (for authentication).
Current file structure, particularly the contents of app.js and any other important files you've created.
Any specific challenges or requirements you're working on.

You don't need to provide the full code unless there's a specific issue. Just a summary of where you are in the project and what you're looking to do next.
